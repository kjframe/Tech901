                <p>Who doesn't enjoy feeling like they constantly learn something new at work? I look forward to
                    persuring a career in tech that allows me to do exactly this. Critical thinking and problem solving
                    as always brought a sense of fulfillment that I have found with coding unlike some other jobs I have
                    had in the past. Working with a team allows for ideas to be passed around and seeing how to solve
                    problems from a different perspective that others may not have thought of.
